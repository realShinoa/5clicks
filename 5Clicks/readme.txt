This website is inspired by a template from this youtube tutorial video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1E_c8KUfGk
The rest of the designs, new scripts (for animations) were added, edited, and modified by us.

Each profile.html (ex. junella.html) were made from duplicating the main website and configuring it by a little bit to turn into our profile page.

Credits:

The particles added were from: https:https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js
(to which we modified the speed, opacity, and the size)

Google map we learned from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U_AAGHzTok&t=231s
(to which we modified to be placed at the bottom of the site, as well as added a drop-down animation using 'sr.reveal ('.mapbox', {delay:300});')'.
